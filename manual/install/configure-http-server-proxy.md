Configure HTTP server: Setup HTTP server as FastCGI proxy
=========================================================

If you have not added configuration for Sympa to HTTP server, follow
instruction below.

Instruction by HTTP servers
---------------------------

### nginx

  1. Add following excerpt to nginx configuration (Note:
     replace [``$PIDDIR``](../layout.md#piddir),
     [``$CSSDIR``](../layout.md#cssdir),
     [``$PICTURESDIR``](../layout.md#picturesdir) and
     [``$STATICDIR``](../layout.md#staticdir) below):
     ``` code
     server {
         listen      80;
         server_name localhost.localdomain;  # Change it!

         location /sympa {
             include       fastcgi_params;
             fastcgi_param SERVER_NAME $host;  # See note
             fastcgi_pass  unix:$PIDDIR/wwsympa.socket;
         }

         # Section below is needed for 6.2.28 or later.
         location /static-sympa/css {
             alias $CSSDIR;
         }
         # Section below is needed for 6.2.28 or later.
         location /static-sympa/pictures {
             alias $PICTURESDIR;
         }
         location /static-sympa {
             alias $STATICDIR;
         }
     }
     ```
     In above, `/static-sympa/css`, `/static-sympa/pictures` and
     `/static-sympa` are the default values of
     [`css_url`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#css_url),
     [`pictures_url`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#pictures_url) and
     [`statoc_content_url`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#static_content_url),
     respectively.

     For the SOAP interface, add this in your ``server`` configuration (Note:
     replace [``$PIDDIR``](../layout.md#piddir)):
     ```code
         location /sympasoap {
             include       fastcgi_params;
             fastcgi_param SERVER_NAME $host;  # See note
             fastcgi_pass  unix:$PIDDIR/sympasoap.socket;
         }
     ```
     See also the notes below.

     > **Note**
     >
     >   * Some binary distributions ship configuration ready to edit:
     >
     >       - On RPM, ``/etc/nginx/conf.d/sympa.conf`` file is prepared by
     >         ``sympa-nginx`` package.
     >
     >   * The line `fastcgi_param SERVER_NAME $host;` after `include` line
     >     is required if you will manage multiple virtual hosts, i.e.
     >     `server_name` directive has multiple server names.
     >
     >   * With earlier version of Sympa, you may have to add following things:
     >
     >       - With Sympa 6.2.54 or earlier, insert these into the section of
     >         "`location /sympa`":
     >         ``` code
     >         fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/sympa)(.*)$;
     >         fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
     >         ```
     >         and these into the section of "`location /sympasoap`", if any:
     >         ``` code
     >         fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/sympasoap)(.*)$;
     >         fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
     >         ```
     >
     >       - Additionally, with Sympa 6.2.19b.2 or earlier, insert this
     >         into the section of "`location /sympa`" (Note:
     >         replace [``$EXECCGIDIR``](../layout.md#execcgidir)).
     >         ``` code
     >         fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $EXECCGIDIR/wwsympa.fcgi;
     >         ```

  2. Edit it as you prefer.

     Note that ``server_name`` directive above should contain host part of
     [``wwsympa_url``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#wwsympa_url) parameter.
     Because
     Sympa refers to ``SERVER_NAME`` CGI environment variable to determine
     web host name of the service.

  3. Restart nginx.
     Then test configuration according to
     [instruction](configure-http-server.md#tests).

### Apache HTTP Server

  1. Add following excerpt to httpd configuration (Note:
     replace [``$PIDDIR``](../layout.md#piddir),
     [``$CSSDIR``](../layout.md#cssdir),
     [``$PICTURESDIR``](../layout.md#picturesdir) and
     [``$STATICDIR``](../layout.md#staticdir) below):
     ``` code
     LoadModule alias_module modules/mod_alias.so
     LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
     LoadModule proxy_fcgi_module modules/mod_proxy_fcgi.so

     ...

     <Location /sympa>
         SetHandler "proxy:unix:$PIDDIR/wwsympa.socket|fcgi://localhost"
         # Don't forget to edit lines below!
         Require local
         #Require all granted
     </Location>

     # Lines below are needed for 6.2.28 or later.
     <Location "/static-sympa/css">
         Require all granted
     </Location>
     Alias /static-sympa/css $CSSDIR

     # Lines below are needed for 6.2.28 or later.
     <Location "/static-sympa/pictures">
         Require all granted
     </Location>
     Alias /static-sympa/pictures $PICTURESDIR

     <Location /static-sympa>
         Require all granted
     </Location>
     Alias /static-sympa $STATICDIR
     ```

     For SOAP interface, add:

     ```
     <Location /sympasoap>
         SetHandler "proxy:unix:$PIDDIR/sympasoap.socket|fcgi://localhost"
         # Don't forget to edit lines below!
         Require local
         #Require all granted
     </Location>
     ```
     In above, `/static-sympa/css`, `/static-sympa/pictures` and
     `/static-sympa` are the default values of
     [`css_url`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#css_url),
     [`pictures_url`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#pictures_url) and
     [`statoc_content_url`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#static_content_url),
     respectively.

     > **Note**
     >
     >   * Some binary distributions ship configuration ready to edit:
     >
     >       - On Debian (12 "bookworm" or later),
     >         ``/etc/apache2/conf-available/sympa.conf`` file is prepared.
     >         Also, separate ``/etc/apache2/conf-available/sympa-soap.conf``
     >         file is prepared for SympaSOAP feature.
     >
     >         **Note** that you may have to enable `proxy_fcgi` Apache module by
     >         running:
     >         ```bash
     >         # a2enmod proxy_fcgi
     >         ```
     >
     >       - On RPM (RHEL/CentOS 7 or later and Fedora),
     >         ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/sympa.conf``
     >         file is prepared by ``sympa-httpd`` package.

  2. Edit it as you prefer.

     Note that ``ServerName`` directive above should contain host part of
     [``wwsympa_url``](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#wwsympa_url) parameter.
     Because
     Sympa refers to ``SERVER_NAME`` CGI environment variable to determine
     web host name of the service.

  3. Restart httpd.
     Then test configuration according to
     [instruction](configure-http-server.md#tests).

### lighttpd

  1. Add following excerpt to lighttpd configuration (Note:
     replace [``$PIDDIR``](../layout.md#piddir),
     [``$CSSDIR``](../layout.md#cssdir),
     [``$PICTURESDIR``](../layout.md#picturesdir) and
     [``$STATICDIR``](../layout.md#staticdir)):
     ```
     server.modules += ("mod_fastcgi")
     server.modules += ("mod_alias")

     # Line below is needed for 6.2.28 or later.
     alias.url += ( "/static-sympa/css/" => "$CSSDIR/" )
     # Line below is needed for 6.2.28 or later.
     alias.url += ( "/static-sympa/pictures/" => "$PICTURESDIR/" )
     alias.url += ( "/static-sympa/" => "$STATICDIR/" )

     $HTTP["url"] =~ "^/sympa" {
     fastcgi.server = ( "/sympa" =>
         ((  "check-local" => "disable",
             "socket"      => "$PIDDIR/wwsympa.socket",
         ))
     )
     }
     ```
     In above, `/static-sympa/css`, `/static-sympa/pictures` and
     `/static-sympa` are the default values of
     [`css_url`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#css_url),
     [`pictures_url`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#pictures_url) and
     [`statoc_content_url`](/gpldoc/man/sympa_config.5.html#static_content_url),
     respectively.

  2. Edit it as you prefer.

  3. Restart lighttpd.
     Then test configuration according to
     [instruction](configure-http-server.md#tests).
